/**
 Encapsulate logic for showing the two types of promo.

 Decision making for showing the promo is based on the following:
 * Is the RMF message enabled?
 * For the sheet: has it been shown already?  The RMF message handles this already (via dismiss button)
 * Is it enabled in the current variant?
 * Is it at least 3 days since install?

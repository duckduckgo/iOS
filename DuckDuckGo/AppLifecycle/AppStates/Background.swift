import UIKit

/// Represents the state where the app is fully in the background and not visible to the user.
/// - Usage:
///   - This state is typically associated with the `applicationDidEnterBackground(_:)` method.
///   - The app transitions to this state when it is no longer in the foreground, either due to the user
///     minimizing the app, switching to another app, or locking the device.
/// - Transitions:
///   - `Foreground`: The app transitions to the `Foreground` state when the user brings the app back to the foreground.
/// - Notes:
///   - Background tasks, such as saving data or refreshing content, should be handled in this state.
///   - Use this state to ensure that the app's current state is saved and any necessary cleanup is performed
///     to release resources or prepare for a potential termination.

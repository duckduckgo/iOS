import UIKit

/// Represents the transient state where the app is in the process of moving out of the foreground.
/// - Usage:
///   - This state is typically associated with the `applicationWillResignActive(_:)` method.
///   - The app transitions to this state when it is temporarily interrupted or begins moving to the background.
///   - Common triggers include:
///     - The user receives a system notification.
///     - The user accesses the App Switcher.
///     - The user starts swiping up to exit the app but does not complete the gesture.
/// - Transitions:
///   - `Foreground`: The app transitions back to `Foreground` if the user dismisses the system notification or
///     returns from the App Switcher to the app without fully transitioning to the background.
///   - `Background`: The app transitions to `Background` if the user completes the gesture to move the app out
///     of the foreground or another action causes the app to enter the background.
/// - Notes:
///   - This is a short-lived state and is part of the app's standard lifecycle.
///   - It allows the app to prepare for a potential transition to `Background`, such as pausing animations
///     or saving transient state information.

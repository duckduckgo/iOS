protocol WebViewNavigation {}

// Used in tests. WKNavigation() crashes on deinit when initialising it manually.
// As workaround we used to Swizzle the implementation of deinit in tests.
// The problem with that approach is that when running different test suites it is possible that unrelated tests re-set the original implementation of deinit while other tests are running.
// This cause the app to crash as the original implementation is executed.
// Defining a protocol for WKNavigation and using mocks such as DummyWKNavigation in tests resolves the problem.

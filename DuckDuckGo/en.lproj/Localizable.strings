Even if you haven’t given apps explicit permission to collect data, they can still take it without your knowledge.\n\nTracking networks like Facebook and Google use these little pieces of information to build a digital profile about you.

The DuckDuckGo browser comes with the features you expect from a go-to browser, like bookmarks, tabs, passwords, and more, plus over [a dozen powerful privacy protections](ddgQuickLink://duckduckgo.com/duckduckgo-help-pages/privacy/web-tracking-protections/) not offered in most popular browsers by default. This uniquely comprehensive set of privacy protections helps protect your online activities, from searching to browsing, emailing, and more.

Our privacy protections work without having to know anything about the technical details or deal with complicated settings. All you have to do is switch your browser to DuckDuckGo across all your devices and you get privacy by default.

But if you *do* want a peek under the hood, you can find more information about how DuckDuckGo privacy protections work on our [help pages](ddgQuickLink://duckduckgo.com/duckduckgo-help-pages/).";

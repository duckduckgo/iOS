## Server for Mock Pages

The integration tests require a server for the mock pages. A server is
automatically launched on port 8000 via the "Run server for mocks" build phase.

You can check if this is running by navigating to a page mock, such as
http://localhost:8000/resourcetrackers.html, to see if it loads.

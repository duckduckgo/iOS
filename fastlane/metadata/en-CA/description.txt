Tired of being tracked online? We can help.

DuckDuckGo is the all-in-one privacy app that helps protect your online activities. With one download you get a new everyday browser that offers seamless protections from most third-party trackers while you search and browse, and access to tracking protections when receiving email. With DuckDuckGo, privacy can be your default.

 • Search Privately - DuckDuckGo Private Search comes built-in so you can search the web without being tracked.

 • Block Tracking Cookies — Prevent most 3rd-party cookies from tracking you as you browse from site to site.

 • Escape Website Trackers Before They Load - We automatically stop most hidden trackers (3rd-party scripts) from loading, which prevents companies from collecting and using any personal data from these trackers.  Our cutting-edge tracker blocking technology – called 3rd-Party Tracker Loading Protection – goes above and beyond what you get in most popular browsers by default.

 • Automatically Enforce Encryption - Smarter Encryption forces many sites you visit in DuckDuckGo to use an encrypted (HTTPS) connection where available, protecting your data from prying eyes.

 • Block Email Trackers - 70% of emails track you as soon as you open them. Enabling Email Protection is the easy way to block most email trackers and hide your address without switching services. Join the private waitlist for the free beta version through the app settings menu.

The DuckDuckGo app has the browsing features you expect, like tabs and bookmarks, plus privacy controls you'll love. Taking control of your privacy doesn't have to mean making tradeoffs.

 • Tap Fire Button, Burn Data - Clear your tabs and browsing data with one tap of the Fire Button.

 • Signal Your Privacy Preference with GPC - Built into the app, Global Privacy Control (GPC) intends to help you express your legal opt-out rights automatically. This will tell websites not to sell or share your personal information under future legal frameworks (e.g., CCPA, GDPR) in various states or countries.

Note about our 3rd-Party Tracker Loading Protection following DuckDuckGo ad clicks: 
Our 3rd-Party Tracker Protection goes above and beyond what you get in most popular browsers by default, but we’re constantly working to make it more comprehensive. Currently, if an advertiser wants to detect conversions on their own website for our private DuckDuckGo search ads, our 3rd-Party Tracker Loading Protection will not stop bat.bing.com requests from loading on the advertiser’s website following DuckDuckGo ad clicks, but those requests are stopped in all other contexts. This is because DuckDuckGo private search advertising is in partnership with Microsoft. As part of that partnership, viewing ads on DuckDuckGo is anonymous and Microsoft has committed to not profile our users’ ad clicks.

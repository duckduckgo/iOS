DuckDuckGo is a free browser that provides the most comprehensive online privacy protection in one app. Unlike most popular browsers, it has powerful privacy protections by default, including our search engine that doesn’t track your history and over a dozen other built-in protections. Millions of people use DuckDuckGo as their go-to browser to protect their everyday online activities, from searching to browsing, emailing, and more.

FEATURE HIGHLIGHTS

• Search Privately by Default: DuckDuckGo Private Search comes built-in, so you can easily search online without being tracked.

• Block Most Trackers Before They Load: Our 3rd-Party Tracker Loading Protection exceeds what most popular browsers offer by default, stopping hidden tracking scripts from loading and collecting your personal data.

• Enable Built-in Email Protection: Block most email trackers and hide your existing email address with @duck.com addresses.

• Automatically Enforce Encryption: Shield your data from network and Wi-Fi snoopers by forcing many sites to use an HTTPS connection.

• Escape Fingerprinting: Make it harder for companies to create a unique identifier for you by blocking attempts to combine info about your browser and device.

• Sync and Backup: Securely sync bookmarks and passwords across your devices.

We feature many protections not available on most browsers, even in private browsing mode, including protection from link tracking, AMP tracking, and more.
 

EVERYDAY PRIVACY CONTROLS

• Clear your tabs and browsing data in a flash with the Fire Button.

• Banish cookie pop-ups and automatically set your preferences to minimize cookies and maximize privacy.  

• Signal Your Privacy Preference with Global Privacy Control (GPC) built into our app. GPC intends to help you express your opt-out rights automatically by telling websites not to sell or share your personal info. Whether it can be used to enforce your legal rights depends on the laws in your jurisdiction.
